Begin development following the EXACT process in `docs/coding-agents/DEVELOPMENT.md`.

**TODO.md is approved - proceed with implementation.**

**Critical requirements:**
1. **Follow TODO.md exactly** - Check off tasks as completed
2. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** - Write failing tests FIRST, then implement
3. **Fix errors immediately** - Never ignore pyright or ruff errors
4. **No backwards compatibility** - Unless explicitly requested
5. **No TODO comments** - Resolve or remove all TODOs before PR

**Remember:**
- Main branch is always green - test failures are from your changes
- Write tests first, implementation second
- Document any deviations from TODO.md for approval

Read `docs/coding-agents/DEVELOPMENT.md` NOW and follow it exactly.
